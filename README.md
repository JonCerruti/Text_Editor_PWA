## Description
This is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that can be installed as a Progressive Web Application. It features a number of Data persistant techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This application also works offline. I started with an existing application and I have implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. I used a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the indexedDB API. This application was deployed using Heroku.

## Usage
The usage of this project is to create code snippets with or without an internet connection, so they can be retrieved for later use.

---

## Installation
First dependencies must be installed using <code> npm i </code> Then from the root of the directory  <code> npm run start:dev </code> will start up the backend and serve the client. This will also bundle up the Javascript files using webpack. This will also run the webpack plugins to generate an HTML file, service worker, and manifest file.
